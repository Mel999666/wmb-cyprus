    bio: "From the vibrant shores of Cyprus emerges Black Strays, a powerhouse of rock'n'roll energy that's as gritty as it is groovy. With a sonic palette painted by groovy heavy riffs and infectious melodic choruses, the four piece band channels the essence of rock through a diverse range of influences spanning the eras from the 70s to the 90s. Their music resonates with echoes of classic rock, hard rock, grunge, stoner, progressive and blues rock, creating a sonic tapestry that's both timeless and innovative. Adding a unique twist to their sound, Black Strays infuse traditional Greek/Cypriot elements, elevating their music to new heights and offering audiences a fresh and exhilarating experience. Described as 'Dirty Groovy Rock n Roll'.", // :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

    bio: "Pitch-black darkness was spawned on the southern shore of the island of Cyprus in April 2024. Inspired by myths of ancient Egypt, scorched by the relentless sun and embraced by the desert wind, KA'APER blended different styles of dark and melodic metal, combining bone-crushing riffs and vocals with catchy melodies and atmospheric ambiances. The project has some blood-chilling stories â€” tales of times when ancient gods walked the Earth and the Nile was young. Welcome to the darkest of times...", // :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
